## Spillover Compensation

### Overview

**What is spillover compensation?**
Spillover occurs when fluorophores emit light that bleeds into adjacent detection channels, creating false positive signals. Compensation mathematically corrects this by subtracting the spillover signal from each channel based on control measurements.

### Step 1: Upload Files

1. Click **"Browse FCS Files"** to upload:
   - **Unstained control** (required): Cells with no fluorescent staining - establishes baseline autofluorescence
   - **Single-stain controls** for each fluorophore (minimum 2 required): Cells stained with only one fluorophore each - measures spillover from that specific fluorophore into other channels
   - **Experimental samples**: Your actual samples with multiple fluorophores


<img width="1240" height="1162" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8d15ee7-5e39-484d-a59f-10ef0a927e31" />


2. **Auto-detected channel formats:**
   - FL formats: FL1-A, FL2-H, FL3-W
   - Laser wavelength: 405 D 525_50-A, 488/530-A
   - FJComp formats: FJ-Comp-A, Comp-PE-A
   - Fluorophore names: FITC-A, PE-H, BV421-A
   - Marker combinations: CD3-FITC-A

### Step 2: Assign File Roles

1. **Select unstained control** from uploaded files
2. **Assign single-stain controls** to each detected channel
3. Click **"Validate File Assignment"** to save assignments


<img width="1221" height="1213" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14089d2c-f4a4-49a6-955e-0498632863ec" />


<img width="1212" height="360" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57c6eb54-eb38-45f3-8138-16a9bbdd2b13" />


<img width="1244" height="742" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11496d30-8278-48dc-8a71-0f62b1eebb05" />


### Step 3: Generate Compensation Matrix

**What is a compensation matrix?**
A mathematical matrix that defines how much signal from each fluorophore spills into other channels. The system uses this to subtract spillover signals from your experimental data.

**Option A: Auto-compute**
- Click **"Compute Spillover Matrix"**
- System automatically calculates using **median method** (uses median fluorescence values from single-stain controls to be robust against outliers)

**Option B: Import existing matrix**
- Upload .csv or Excel (.xlsx) file with pre-calculated compensation values
- Matrix must be square with fluorophores as row/column names
- Useful when you have standardized compensation from instrument software


<img width="2491" height="956" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6298e6b-651a-4180-a9d9-6bafad77266d" />


### Step 4: Review & Edit Matrix

- **Color coding:**
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Low spillover (0-1%)
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Moderate (1-5%)
  - ðŸŸ  Orange: High (5-10%)
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Very high (>10%)
- Enable editing to modify values manually
- Click **"Reset to Original"** to undo changes


<img width="566" height="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7431a498-d970-477b-8d84-75463e0f978a" />


### Step 5: Quality Control

1. **Select channels** to analyze (subset of compensated channels)
2. **Set sample size** (1,000-50,000 events) - smaller samples = faster processing
3. Click **"Run QC Analysis"**

**Key QC metrics explained:**
- **Negative events percentage**: Should be <5% after compensation. High percentages indicate over-compensation or poor controls
- **Signal spread (CV)**: Coefficient of variation measures how tight your positive population is. Lower CV = better separation
- **Before/after comparison**: Visual check that compensation improved channel separation without creating artifacts

**What good compensation looks like:**
- Positive populations shift toward axes (less spillover)
- Negative populations stay near zero
- No new negative populations created

### Step 6: Export Results

- **Compensated FCS files**: Download with "_compensated" suffix
- **Spillover matrix**: Export as CSV or Excel
- **Session data**: Save complete workflow for later use

<img width="1222" height="865" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f639b97-cee0-4d19-95b4-d6e010694416" />

## Interactive Gating

### Overview

**What is gating?**
Gating is the process of selecting specific cell populations based on their fluorescence or scatter properties. You draw boundaries (gates) around populations of interest to separate them from other cells for analysis.

**Why use hierarchical gating?**
Start with broad populations (e.g., live cells) and progressively refine to specific subsets (e.g., CD4+ T cells). This ensures accurate population identification and reduces background interference.

### Step 1: Setup Data Source

**Choose one:**
- Use preprocessed data from Raw Data tab
- Load new FCS files directly
- 
<img width="600" height="347" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81e703fa-a801-4cdb-96fc-6549d75494ee" />

**Select parameters:**
- Sample from dropdown
- X and Y axis channels for 2D plots

<img width="563" height="328" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65421dbe-251e-407a-a16c-373c36e51932" />

### Step 2: Create Gates

1. **Enter population name**
2. **Select gate type**
3. Click **"Start Gating"**
4. **Draw gate:**
   - **Static mode**: Click points or use brush selection
   - **Interactive mode**: Use plotly toolbar (box/lasso select)
5. Click **"Save Gate"** when complete

   
<img width="575" height="619" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdf0a0be-e060-4347-8412-ef4ca38e480c" />


<img width="1380" height="913" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8356fabf-9cff-4b2c-908c-05c467a82e0a" />


<img width="1358" height="890" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fb38931-9f9e-44ae-b96c-c2c77d19d29d" />


### Step 3: Visualization Options

**Plot modes explained:**
- **Static mode**: Shows all events simultaneously, better performance for large datasets (>10,000 events). Recommended for most gating tasks
- **Interactive mode**: Limited to 10,000 randomly sampled events but provides full zoom, pan, and selection tools. Use when you need precise navigation

**Plot types and when to use them:**
- **Scatter plot**: Basic dot plot showing individual events. Best for small datasets or when you need to see every single event
- **Density hotspots**: Points colored by local cell density (red = high density, blue = low). Excellent for identifying main populations and rare events
- **Hotspots + contours**: Combines density coloring with population boundary lines. Ideal for complex samples with multiple overlapping populations
- **Hexagon plot**: Divides plot into hexagonal bins showing event counts. Essential for very large datasets (>100,000 events) where individual points would overlap

### Step 4: Hierarchical Gating

**How hierarchy works:**
- **Start with "root"** (all events in your sample)
- **Select parent population** for sub-gating (e.g., gate lymphocytes from root, then CD4+ cells from lymphocytes)
- **View hierarchy tree** with real-time counts showing how populations relate to each other
- **Edit/delete gates** - changes automatically update all downstream populations

<img width="589" height="159" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/641771f8-4b90-4317-9328-6574a10753c8" />

<img width="595" height="321" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48627011-142f-4b44-a837-503cf364c72f" />

**Understanding population statistics:**
- **Event count**: Absolute number of events in this population
- **% of parent**: What percentage of the immediate parent population this represents
- **% of total**: What percentage of all original events this represents
- **Hierarchy depth**: Shows how many gating steps deep you are (root â†’ lymphocytes â†’ CD4+ T cells = 3 levels)

### Step 5: Population Analysis

**Real-time statistics:**
- Event counts per population (updates as you modify gates)
- Percentage of parent and total events
- Hierarchical organization showing parent-child relationships

**Data extraction explained:**
- **Select specific populations**: Choose which gated populations to export for further analysis
- **Extract as flowSet objects**: FlowSet is a standard R/Bioconductor data structure containing flow cytometry data that can be used in downstream analysis software
- **Apply all gates**: Ensures your extracted data includes all gating decisions in the hierarchy

## Batch Analysis

### Overview

**What is batch analysis?**
Batch analysis allows you to process multiple flow cytometry samples simultaneously with standardized parameters. This ensures consistent analysis across experimental groups and enables statistical comparisons between samples and conditions.

**Why use batch analysis?**
- **Consistency**: Apply identical processing parameters across all samples
- **Efficiency**: Process dozens of samples at once instead of one by one
- **Comparison**: Generate standardized results for statistical analysis between groups
- **Reproducibility**: Save processing templates for future experiments

### Step 1: Sample Management

1. **Upload multiple files**:
   - Click **"Browse Files"** to select multiple .fcs, .csv, or .tsv files
   - Files can be from different experimental groups or conditions
   - Each file becomes a separate sample in your batch

2. **Automatic grouping** (optional):
   - **Filename pattern grouping**: Files are automatically assigned to groups based on naming patterns
   - **Control pattern**: Enter text pattern that identifies control samples (e.g., "ctrl", "control")
   - **Treated pattern**: Enter text pattern that identifies treated samples (e.g., "treat", "stim")
   - **Manual grouping**: Assign groups manually if automatic detection doesn't work

3. **Sample list management**:
   - View all uploaded samples with their assigned groups
   - **Remove individual samples** or **clear entire batch**
   - Check sample details before processing

1. **Enable population identification** to automatically name clusters
2. **Expression thresholds**:
   - **High expression threshold**: Level considered "positive" for a marker (default: 0.5)
   - **Low expression threshold**: Level considered "negative" for a marker (default: -0.5)
3. **Confidence threshold**: Minimum confidence required for population assignment (default: 30%)

**How it works:**
- System analyzes mean marker expression for each cluster
- Compares to thresholds to determine positive/negative markers
- Generates population names like "CD4+CD8-" or "B cells"
- Assigns confidence scores based on separation from thresholds

### Step 6: Visualization and Results

**Plot options:**
- **Show cluster labels**: Display cluster numbers on plots
- **Show population labels**: Display identified population names
- **Color by**: Choose to color by cluster ID, population, or sample group
- **Point density visualization**: Show cell density within populations

**Cluster management:**
- **Merge clusters**: Combine similar clusters manually if needed
- **Edit population names**: Modify automatic population assignments
- **View cluster statistics**: See event counts and percentages per cluster/population

### Step 7: Export and Templates

**Export options:**
- **Visualization plots**: Export plots as PDF or PNG

**Template management:**
- **Save processing template**: Save all parameters for reuse on future experiments
- **Load template**: Apply saved parameter sets to new batches
- **Template library**: Organize templates by experiment type or research question

## Troubleshooting

### Compensation Issues

**Diagonal matrix values â‰  1.0:**
- **Cause**: Poor single-stain control quality
- **Solution**: Check that controls have bright, positive populations

**Negative spillover values:**
- **Cause**: Incorrect file assignment or poor controls
- **Solution**: Verify file assignments and control quality

**Spillover levels >50%:**
- **Cause**: Spectral overlap too high for reliable compensation
- **Solution**: Consider different fluorophore combinations

**High negative events after compensation:**
- **Cause**: Over-compensation
- **Solution**: Reduce spillover values manually in matrix editor

### Gating Issues

**Slow performance:**
- **Solution**: Use Static mode for datasets >10,000 events

**Population counts not updating:**
- **Solution**: Click "Refresh display" to recalculate hierarchy

**Can't see populations clearly:**
- **Solution**: Try density hotspots or hexagon plots for better visualization

**Gates not saving:**
- **Solution**: Ensure you click "Save Gate" after drawing each gate

**Sub-gates appearing empty:**
- **Solution**: Check that parent population selection is correct

### File Format Issues

**Channels not detected:**
- **Cause**: Non-standard channel naming
- **Solution**: Ensure FCS files use standard naming conventions (FL1-A, FITC-A, etc.)

**Import failures:**
- **Cause**: Corrupted files or invalid format
- **Solution**: Verify FCS files contain actual flow cytometry data

### Performance Issues

**Slow processing:**
- **Solution**: Reduce number of events analyzed or use sampling
- **Solution**: Enable Barnes-Hut approximation for t-SNE

**Browser freezing:**
- **Solution**: Use smaller datasets or increase browser memory allocation
- **Solution**: 
- **Solution**: Close other browser tabs and applications

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What file formats does CytoVerse support?**
A: CytoVerse supports .fcs (Flow Cytometry Standard), .csv, .tsv, and .xlsx files. FCS files are recommended for best compatibility across all features.

**Q: What's the maximum file size I can upload?**
A: The current limit is 250MB per upload session. For larger datasets, consider using the batch analysis features or data sampling.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How does the automatic population identification work?**
A: The system analyzes mean marker expression for each cluster and compares values to user-defined thresholds. Populations are named based on positive/negative marker combinations with confidence scores.
However, we are currently working on a way to allow users to specify their own populations to allow for a wider coverage of markers.

**Q: Can I export my gating strategy for use in other software?**
A: Yes, you can export gate definitions as CSV files and population statistics for analysis in other platforms like FlowJo or FCS Express.

**Q: How do I choose between t-SNE and UMAP for dimensionality reduction?**
A: Use t-SNE for discovering local structure and rare populations. Use UMAP when you need to preserve both local and global relationships, or for faster processing of large datasets.

### Workflow Questions

**Q: Do I need to compensate my data before gating?**
A: Yes, compensation should always be performed before gating when using multi-color panels. This removes fluorophore spillover that could affect population identification.

**Q: Can I apply the same gating strategy to multiple samples?**
A: Yes, use the template system in Interactive Gating to save gating strategies and apply them to new samples. For automated processing, use the Batch Analysis module.

**Q: How do I know if my compensation is working correctly?**
A: Check the QC metrics: negative event percentage should be <5%, and you should see improved separation between positive and negative populations in before/after plots.
